# Cecil Community R SDK

This is a community-supported R SDK for [Cecil Earth](https://cecil.earth/). The SDK integrates with the internal API using standard HTTP methods, authentication, and response codes. The data resources use RFC 3339 timestamps and universally unique identifiers (UUID v4). `devtools` and RTools are required, as well as R version >= 4.0.
